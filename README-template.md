## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Animista](https://animista.net/) - for custom animation

### What I learned

Solving this challenge was supposed to be a training of flexbox property usage. I added a gradient transition and a little animation using Animista CSS library, to my taste.
I had a wide range of solutions of another challenge to peek for tips. Despite that I didn't manage to make the design responsive the way I should have been. 

### Continued development

I plan to take a break at this point and learn JS. I'll be solving challenges here and there.

### Useful resources

- [Animista](https://animista.net/) - great animation library, I liked it.
